# Oculus Quest Freedom
One of the drawbacks to disconnecting a Quest 2 from FB is losing access to applications from your Oculus App Library. 
This page documents a process to legitimately obtain APKs for Oculus & AppLab apps, and my results testing various apps.

Note that some applications may still fail to launch or display entitlement errors.

## Requirements: 
* Oculus [Developer Account](https://developer.oculus.com) to unlock Developer mode
* Development Mode Enabled (via Occulus Mobile App)
* [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com) to sideload APKs
* [Oculess](https://github.com/basti564/Oculess) to unlink FB 

## Getting Quest APKs
1. Login to [Oculus](https://secure.oculus.com/) from a browser 
2. Open a new tab to [OculusDB](https://oculusdb.rui2015.me) 
3. Search OculusDB for apps in your Oculus Library
4. Select 'Details' for the desired app search result
5. Scroll down to the 'Connected' section and select 'Versions'
6. Click 'Download' on the app version desired
7. Install the APK using SideQuest

* _If you are not logged into Oculus, download links will likely fail._
* _If do not have the app in your Oculus Library, download links will likely fail._
* _Some applications may still fail to launch or display entitlement errors._
